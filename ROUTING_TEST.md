# Routing Test Instructions

## Test the Navigation Links

1. **Open the application**: Go to `http://localhost:5173`

2. **Test Platform Features Navigation**:
   - Click on "Platform" in the main navigation
   - Click on "Platform Features" from the dropdown
   - Should navigate to `/features` and show the FeatureGrid component

3. **Test Direct URLs**:
   - Try these URLs directly in your browser:
     - `http://localhost:5173/features`
     - `http://localhost:5173/instructor-portal`
     - `http://localhost:5173/student-portal`
     - `http://localhost:5173/ai-video-calling`
     - `http://localhost:5173/mobile-courses`
     - `http://localhost:5173/world-class-lms-features`

4. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Check for any JavaScript errors
   - Look for React Router errors

5. **Verify Components Load**:
   - Each URL should show the corresponding component
   - No 404 errors should occur
   - Components should render properly

## Expected Results

- All navigation links should work
- Direct URLs should load the correct components
- No console errors related to routing
- Components should display their content properly

## Troubleshooting

If navigation is not working:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the server is running on port 5173
3. Try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Clear browser cache
5. Check if React Router is properly configured
